                    <h2>Preparation steps</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Prepare the Pancakes: Whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl until combined. Add buttermilk, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla; stir until just combined. Stir in carrots and melted butter until just combined. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>Prepare the Frosting: In a medium bowl, whisk together cream cheese, milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>Prepare the Topping: In a small bowl, stir together raisins, pecans, coconut, and ginger, if desired. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium. Grease skillet or griddle with butter.</li>
                            <li>Working in batches, scoop 1/4 cup batter per pancake into the skillet, being sure not to overcrowd skillet. Cook until bubbles begin to form on surface of pancakes and edges look dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, and cook until fluffy and slightly firm, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter, adding butter and adjusting heat as needed.</li>
                            <li>Divide pancakes evenly among 4 plates. Drizzle Pancakes evenly with Frosting, and sprinkle evenly with Topping.</li>
